# Scrozam!

*Scrozam!* is a web application that detects songs using the ACRCloud API and scrobbles the identified tracks to a user's Last.fm account.

## Features
- Detects songs from audio input.
- Scrobbles detected tracks to Last.fm.
- Displays detected track information to the user.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
- ACRCloud and Last.fm accounts

### Steps

1. **Add API Tokens to .env Files**
   - Create a `.env` file in both the `backend` and `frontend` directories.
   - Add your ACRCloud and Last.fm API tokens to these files.

   Example `.env` file content:
   ```env
   ACR_URL="your_url"
   ACR_ACCESS_KEY="your_acr_access_key"
   ACR_SHARED="your_acr_shared_secret"

   LAST_API_KEY="your_lastfm_api_key"
   LAST_SHARED_SECRET="your_lastfm_shared_secret"
   ```

2. **Start the Backend Server**
    - Navigate to the `backend` directory.
    - Run the following command to start the backend server:
    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```

3. **Authenticate with Last.fm**
    - Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3000/auth.
    - Sign in with your Last.fm account and authorize the application.
    - You will be redirected back to the application with a session key.

4. **Confirm Session Key**
    - Check the backend server logs to confirm that the session key has been successfully retrieved and stored.

5. **Start the Frontend Application**
    - Navigate to the `frontend` directory.
    - Run the following command to start the frontend application:
    ```bash
    npm start
    ```
    - Type "y" to allow the frontend to start on 3001. 

6. **Detect Songs**
    - Open your browser and go to http://localhost:3001.
    - Click the "Start Listening" button and play some music.
       - The application will detect the song and display the track information.
   - Alternatively, select the "Continuous listening" toggle and play music endlessly
      - Scrozam will automatically detect changes to the current song.
      - No song duplication, no missing tracks, just smooth listening!

Sample response in backend:
```
ACRCloud Response: {
...
}
Full music data from ACRCloud: {
...
}
Detected Song -> Title: Killah, Artist: Lady Gaga
Stored detected song: { title: 'Killah', artist: 'Lady Gaga' }
Posted detected song to backend: Killah by Lady Gaga
ðŸŽ§ Sending detected song to frontend: Killah - Lady Gaga
```

To avoid duplication, if the same song is detected, you will see:
```ðŸ“­ No new song detected, returning null.```

*Note*: In continuous listening mode, please allow for some time to pass before the detected song self-updates.

<details>
<summary>It is normal to see the following when a song first switches:</summary>
<br>

```
ACRCloud Response: { status: { code: 1001, version: '1.0', msg: 'No result' } }
No result detected. Retrying...
ðŸ“­ No new song detected, returning null.
ðŸ“­ No new song detected, returning null.
ðŸ“­ No new song detected, returning null.
ðŸ“­ No new song detected, returning null.
```

The song **WILL** update eventually, usually before the midpoint of the current song. If for whatever reason it gets caught in a `No result` loop, please contact me.

- Add more detailed song information display.
    - Show album art on page for better user experience.
- Implement more robust error handling.
- Information tab.
